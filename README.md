# 🚌 WHISTLE App: UI/UX Case Study

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project is a UI/UX case study for Whistle, a mobile application designed to simplify local bus travel. The goal was to create an easy and convenient commuting experience by providing users with real-time bus tracking, route information, and estimated arrival and departure times.

---

## ⚠️ The Problem  
Local bus travel often presents several challenges for commuters:

- Passengers frequently have to rely on word-of-mouth to get information about a bus's route and status.  
- Standing in long queues for buses is a time-consuming and frustrating task.  
- There is a lack of real-time information, such as live bus tracking and arrival times.  

---

## 🎯 The Goals  
Based on the problems identified, the project focused on three main goals:

- **Check Arrival and Departure Time**: Provide users with accurate ETAs (estimated time of arrival) and ETDs (estimated time of departure).  
- **Live Tracking of Bus using GPS**: Allow users to track the real-time location of buses to reduce waiting times.  
- **Finding Different Routes to the Same Destination**: Offer multiple route options to help users choose the best path based on time and convenience.

## 🎨 Design Process  
The design process for the Whistle app followed a structured, user-centered approach:

### 1. 🤝 Empathize  
- **Competitive Analysis**: We analyzed existing solutions to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Key findings included a lack of live tracking and notification features, and complex interfaces that were hard to navigate.  
- **Affinity Mapping**: We gathered user motivations, pain points, and goals.  
  - **Motivations**: Travel comfortably, catch a bus without a long wait, plan the day based on travel time.  
  - **Pain Points**: Long waiting times, crowded buses, difficulty with fare payment, communication barriers with conductors.  
  - **Goals**: Live track buses, find the closest bus stop, compare routes and timings, and reduce travel costs.  

### 2. ✏️ Define  
- **User Persona**: Two primary user personas were created to represent the target audience.  
  - **Planner Pradeep**: A punctual and systematic planner who values an easy and hassle-free journey.  
  - **Cautious Kaushik**: A conservative spender who is careful about his belongings and prefers cheap travel over comfort.  
- **User Scenario**: A user scenario was developed to illustrate how a user named Rahul would use the Whistle app to plan his daily commute, from waking up to arriving at college on time.  

### 3. 🤔 Ideate  
- **Task Flow**: The complete task flow for the application was mapped out, from signing up to tracking a bus.  
- **Site Map**: A visual representation of the app's structure was created to ensure a logical and easy-to-navigate user journey.  

### 4. 📐 Design  
- **Low Fidelity Wireframes**: Initial sketches and layouts were created to visualize the app's structure.  
- **Color Palette**: A color palette was chosen with blue as the primary color, symbolizing trust, calmness, and confidence.  
  - **Primary**: #0476D9  
  - **Secondary**: #169EF2  
  - **Tertiary**: #79DCF3  
- **Typography**: The typeface "Montserrat" was used for headings and "Roboto" for body text to ensure readability and a clean aesthetic.  

### 5. ✅ Test  
- **Usability Testing**: Feedback from usability testing led to key design changes:  
  - The submit button was removed from the search page as the destination name would auto-generate.  
  - A common bottom navigation bar was added to improve navigation between screens.  
  - The option to compare buses was integrated directly into the bus list, making it easier for users to make a quick decision.  
- **Final Design**: The final designs incorporate these changes, resulting in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Figma**: For creating high-fidelity prototypes and final UI designs.  
- **Sketch**: For early-stage design and wireframing.  
- **Balsamiq**: For creating low-fidelity wireframes.  
- **Adobe Illustrator**: For creating illustrations and visual assets.

## ✨ The Result  
The final design for the Whistle app provides a comprehensive solution for bus commuters. It features a clean interface, live bus tracking, detailed route information, and an intuitive navigation system, making local bus travel an easy and convenient experience.
